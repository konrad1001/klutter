# Klutter

Klutter is tiny reproduction of Flutter, intended to explore exactly *how* Flutter bridges the gap between dart and native code on multiple platforms. 

## So far
- IOS support
- `create` an empty project, with ios templating.
- `build` and `run` an ios app onto simulator.
- `devices`, list available ios simulators and physical devices. 

## For the future
- Very simple engine.
- Expand device support.
